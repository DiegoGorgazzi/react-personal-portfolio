# React Personal Portfolio page
Here's what it looks like: [Portofolio Page Sample](https://diegogorgazzi.firebase.com)

This is a personal project that I originally set as private because I was going to do it quick and dirty.

Turns out it was anything but quick (though still a little dirtyish :relaxed: ). Still, it has some pretty neat features I'd thought I'd share.

### Features
* CSS modules, so we don't lose track of what we're doing.
* Several Reusable components. Yay!
 For example:
 * Do you have several Project categories? Just wrapped them in the &#60;ProjCategory&#62; element.
 * Have a long list of Projects? Just make sure your list is an object with the properties described, then import it and wrapped it in a &#60;Projects&#62; element.
 * Show/Hide anything, and customize the text, simply by using the &#60;ToggleVisibility&#62; element.

### Nice to have at some point in the future
* A login/authentication feature for backend editing (e.g. being able to customize layout, color, styling, content, etc, etc without the need to mess with code).
* Although the entire world (and according to Star Wars and Star Trek, the entire Universe) speaks English, it'd be nice to let the user pick the language of the page.
* A reusable component to display the menu in burger form when using mobile devices.
* A reusable component to make the projects be displayed Netflix style.
* A "contact me" form.

##  Contributing
Please contribute! If not, then you can still go forth an conquer... but if you make a good addition to your own project it would be nice if you can share it :gift:

### Code of Conduct
Please keep it professionally clean and friendly. That includes, but is not limited to:
* Being patient. If you get frustrated, step away from the keyboard for a few minutes or hours before you do something you might regret later (if you need a few days, maybe you're in the wrong business?).
* Being all inclusive. We are all people of different age, sex, religion, race, nationality, etc, etc. But, we're all people. Treat people like people and that'll be a good start.

### Time is always in short supply
* I seem to never have time for anything. This is the story of my life. There's always another project in the pipeline that needs (or would be nice) to be done and applying improvements to past projects is always a challenge. Still, I'll do my best to come back to this. If you contribute and I don't reply right away please accept my apologies in advance but know your contribution is important and I will reply as soon as possible.
