  <h3> I Love Solving Problems </h3>

  <p> I started this journey trying to solve a specific problem.  Because of these skills,
    the funny thing is I now believe that problem I wanted to solve is insignificant compared to
     the other problems I now envision I could help solve. </p>

  <p> I did my first website in 2011. It was a WYSIWYG.
  It was limited, terrible, and more importantly, what you
  saw was not what you got. But I needed it for my job. </p>

  <p> Soon thereafter I found WordPress. It was flexible,
    customizable, full of functionality, simple to use.
    I ended up doing many websites some of which are still around
    today. In time, I found the limitations of WordPress as well. </p>

  <p> To solve a specific problem I had, I figured I needed to learn
  Python, which I did a few years ago. </p>

  <p>This is where I realized
  that learning a specific coding language is like learning
  how to make a specific component of a car: you may know how to
  build the engine, but you don't know how to build a car
  until you learn about the other components and how they
  interact with each other.
  I ended up not having a clear path of where to go next. So aside
  from a few Project Euler challenges, I tucked that snake away.</p>

  <p> Then I saw the light at the end of the tunnel with
  JavaScript (actually, with React). Thanks mainly to freeCodeCamp
  and Udemy, I was able to find a clear path to follow. </p>

<p> When I graduated from Engineering School almost 20 years ago, I didn't think
  there was much more to learn.</p>

<p> But starting with my first day of work, I discovered Not only I didn't know
  anything right out of school,
  but I learned a new thing  every single day of my career (and my humility
  seemed to have grown exponentially the more I realized how much
  I didn't know and will never know).</p>

  <p>You cannot graduate from knowledge.
  Old Socrates was right, "I know that I know nothing". The other life lesson I
  learned is it takes more than
  one person to build anything. </p>

  <p> So,
  I expect to keep learning and cooperating with people every day of my life,
  but let me entertain you with what little
  I've done so far in the app development world. One day I hope to solve a meaningful
  problem with these skills
  so stay tuned. </p>

  <p> Thanks for Reading! </p>
