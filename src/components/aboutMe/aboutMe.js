  <h3> I Love Solving Problems </h3>

  <p> I started this journey trying to solve a specific problem and now that
  problem seems so little with all the other problems I now envision I could help solve
  just because of my new found knowledge. </p>

  <p> I did my first website in 2011. It was a WYSIWYG.
  It was limited, terrible, and more importantly, what you
  saw was not what you got. But I needed it for my job. </p>

  <p> Soon thereafter I found WordPress. It was flexible,
    customizable, full of functionality, simple to use.
    I ended up doing many websites some of which are still around
    today. In time, I found the limitations of WordPress as well. </p>

  <p> To solve a specific problem I had, I figured I needed to learn
  Python, which I did a few years ago. This is where I realized
  that learning a specific coding language is like learning
  how to make a specific component of a car: you may know how to
  build the engine, but you don't know how to build a car
  until you learn about the other components and how they
  interact with each other.
  I ended up not having a clear path of where to go next. So aside
  from a few Project Euler challenges, I tucked that snake away.</p>

  <p> Then I saw the light at the end of the tunnel with
  JavaScript (actually, with React). Thanks mainly to freeCodeCamp
  and Udemy, I was able to find a clear direction of where I
  needed to go. </p>

  <p> When I graduated from Engineering School almost 20 years ago, I didn't think there was much to
  learn. I discovered Not only I didn't know anything right out of school, but I learned a new thing
  every single day of my career (and my humility seemed to have grown exponentially the more I realize how much
  I don't know and will never know).
  Old Socrates was right, "I know that I know nothing". The other life lesson I learned is it takes more than
  one person to build anything. </p>

  <p> So,
  I expect to keep learning every day until I die, but let me entertain you with what little
  I've done so far in the app developer world. One day I hope to solve a meaningful problem with these skills
  so stay tuned. </p>

  <p> Thanks for Reading! </p>
